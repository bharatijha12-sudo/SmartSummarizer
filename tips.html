          <h3>1. Pomodoro Method</h3>
          <p>Study for 25 minutes with full focus, then take a 5-minute break. After four cycles, take a longer break (15–20 minutes). This prevents burnout and keeps your brain fresh.</p>

        <article class="tip-item">
          <h3>2. Active Recall</h3>
          <p>Close your book and try to write down or speak out whatever you remember. Testing yourself strengthens your memory much more than just reading or highlighting.</p>

        <article class="tip-item">
          <h3>3. Spaced Repetition</h3>
          <p>Instead of revising the same topic again and again in one day, revise it today, then after 2 days, then after 1 week. This spacing trains your brain to store information long-term.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="tip-item">
          <h3>4. Environment Control</h3>
          <p>Keep your phone away, turn off unnecessary notifications, and study on a clean desk. Your environment silently controls how much you can focus.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="tip-item">
          <h3>5. Mix Subjects Wisely</h3>
          <p>Alternate between theory-heavy subjects and problem-solving subjects. This keeps your brain from getting bored and improves overall performance.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="tip-item">
          <h3>6. Sleep & Health</h3>
          <p>All-night study looks cool but kills your memory. Proper sleep, hydration, and light exercise will help you perform way better in exams.</p>
